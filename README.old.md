React Admin Dashboard following [@ed-roh](https://github.com/ed-roh/)'s [youtube tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wYpCWwD1oz0&t). 

The app was built using React, Material UI, Nivo Charts, Formik, Yup, FullCalendar, and Data Grid to build this entire application. 

The app consists of Light and Dark Mode, 4 different Charts, 3 different Data Table Pages, FAQ Page, Form Page, and Calendar Integration.
